# 👩‍💻 LMU Devs · Welcome to the Hub!

Welcome to the official LMU Devs GitHub org! This is your starting point for everything we’re building, sharing, and collaborating on as developers, designers, researchers, and makers from LMU Munich.

## 🌟 Who We Are

LMU Devs is a growing community of students, alumni, and collaborators who are passionate about building cool things — from web and mobile apps to experimental AI projects and research-driven tools.

We come from different backgrounds — Human-Computer Interaction, Informatics, UX Design, Media Informatics, and more — but we share one goal: **to create meaningful digital experiences and learn together**.

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

This GitHub organization is home to:
- 🚀 Student & group projects
- 🧪 Research prototypes & theses
